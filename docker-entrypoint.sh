# Container entrypoint with isolate v2 cgroup-mode setup.
#
# When cgroup v2 is mounted RW (privileged container, modern kernel),
# we lay out a sibling cgroup hierarchy so isolate can use --cg mode and
# enforce per-question memory_limit as RSS (memory.max) instead of
# RLIMIT_AS (virtual address). Without this, Java/Node/Python-ML
# submissions fail at any memory_limit < ~1.5 GiB because their runtimes
# pre-reserve huge virtual address blocks even when actual RSS is small.
#
# Layout we want at startup:
#
#   /sys/fs/cgroup/                    container's root cgroup (delegated by K8s/Docker)
#     ├── api.scope/                   Rails / Resque workers move here (PID 1's new home)
#     └── isolate.slice/               isolate v2 creates per-box children under this
#         ├── box-0/
#         └── ...
#
# cgroup v2's "no internal process constraint" forbids a cgroup from
# having both direct member processes AND `subtree_control` enabled. We
# work around that by moving everything currently in the parent into
# `api.scope` first, then enabling subtree_control on the now-empty parent.
#
# isolate v2's default config is `cg_root = "auto:/run/isolate/cgroup"`,
# meaning isolate reads the actual cgroup path from `/run/isolate/cgroup`.
# We write that pointer here (no systemd `isolate-cg-keeper` needed).
#
# When cgroup setup succeeds, we export OVERRIDE_PER_PROCESS_*=false so
# judge0.conf's `${OVERRIDE_*:-true}` evaluates to "false", which makes
# Config::ENABLE_PER_PROCESS_*=false, which makes IsolateJob add `--cg`,
# which makes isolate use memory.max instead of RLIMIT_AS.
#
# When cgroup setup fails (cgroup v1 host, non-privileged, or controllers
# not delegated), we leave OVERRIDE_* unset and isolate stays in rlimit
# mode. Per-question memory limits then need ≥ ~2 GiB for JVM/Node, but
# the stack still works for C/Go/Python.
